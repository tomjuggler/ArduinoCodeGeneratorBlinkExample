# ArduinoCodeGeneratorBlinkExample
A method to generate Arduino sketches easily from Processing. 

/**
 * Here is a nice way to directly generate an Arduino sketch from Processing code. 
 * You can define your variables in Processing and easily generate versions of Arduino sketches according to your needs
 * Arduino sketch called output gets generated in output folder in processing sketch data folder
 * working using Processing version 2.2.1 - running on Ubuntu 14.04 if that makes any difference... tested working on Windows 7 as well
 * modified from Button processing example sketch in the Gui section. Generating a blink Arduino sketch as an example. 
 * Click on one of the colored squares in the
